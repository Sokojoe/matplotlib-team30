according to mpl api docs, lower zorder gets drawn first

xticklabel zorder is 3
line zorder is 2
- so technically line should be drawn first, xtick on top
    - but thats not the case...

in example screenshot
    - pink line has zorder 1
    - red line has zorder 2
    - pitick has zorder 3
    - pitick bbox has zorder 4
